At Revisn, we plan to support multiple guests part of one reservation - for example, its possible for a family to stay in one of our 2 bedroom units. While we can store the primary guests name and email address in Mews, it seems that there is no way to store information about additional guests through the Mews API. Without this, reservations that have multiple guests would require them to manually check in at the front desk for our concierge to know about the additional guests. Is there any way to store this information in the MEWs API, and display it on the Mews Dashboard? If not, is there another existing field that we can use to store this? This would greatly alleviate our pain, and allow us to continue the check-in-less experience for our guests. Let me know if you want to hop on a call to understand more.
